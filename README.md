# cmpt353proj

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels

Steps to run (follow in order):
1. IMPORTANT! Do not change the internal folder structure.
2. IMPORTANT! Must unzip "/Data/data.zip" without moving it to a different location.
3. Run the projectnotebook.ipynb from top to bottom. 
   It will produce the following files:
    - /data.csv
    - /formatted.csv

projectnotebook.ipynb does not run anything from the cluster.py module because we were
not able to produce any meaningful results from it in the given time. 
However, we included the code for completeness.
